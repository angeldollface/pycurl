# PY CURL :inbox_tray: :snake:

![GitHub CI](https://github.com/angeldollface/pycurl/actions/workflows/python.yml/badge.svg)

***A small command line tool to download files. :inbox_tray: :snake:***

## ABOUT :books:

When I quickly want to download files from the internet, I usually use `wget` to do that. Some time ago, I was wondering if I could, perhaps, write something similar in Python. This is that something.

## USAGE :hammer:

### REQUIREMENTS

You should have the following tools installed and available from the command line:

- [Git](https://git-scm.org)
- [Python 3.5+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Pip for Python 3.5+ (Usually comes with Python.)

### INSTALLING *PY CURL* ON YOUR SYSTEM

To use *Py Curl* on your own system with your own projects, run the following command:

```bash
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/angeldollface/pycurl
```

### USING *PY CURL* TO DOWNLOAD A FILE

To download a file, simply run this command (Here `your_file_url` represents a URL to a file.):

```bash
python -m pycurl your_file_url
```

## CHANGELOG :black_nib:
